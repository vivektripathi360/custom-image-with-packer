Packer Custom Image using HCL
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how I created a custom virtual machine image using Packer with HCL language.
The custom image is pre-configured with required software and application so that new VMs can be launched quickly without manual setup.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Packer – for building custom VM images
HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) – to define Packer configuration
Cloud Platform – Azure 
Linux (Ubuntu) – base operating system
Shell Script – for software installation & configuration
Git & GitHub – version control and code management

🧠 Why Packer?

Manual VM setup is time-consuming and error-prone
Packer helps create immutable, reusable images
Same image can be used across Dev, Test, and Prod environments
Faster VM provisioning and consistent configuration
